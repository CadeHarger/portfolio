# WebApps Fall 2023

This is the repo containing my classwork for my Fall 2023 Web Applications course, taught by Dr. Mark Lewis. The course split up work into mini-projects, aka tasks. Tasks 1-2, 3, 4, and 10 are usable [here](https://cs.trinity.edu/~charger/WebApps/). The rest were deployed on school computers, so you'll just have to look at the code for those.

## Task Descriptions:

### Task 1-2 (HTML, CSS):
Wrote and styled the index page for all tasks as well as an About Me page.
_Code viewable in browser_

### Task 3 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
Imported NBA team statistics and wrote JavaScript to help visualize and sort the data.

### Task 4 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
