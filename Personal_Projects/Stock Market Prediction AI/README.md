### Stock_Market_AI.ipynb

This was my first attempt at predicting the stock market. I just used 1D Convolution layers, which seemed the most logical. Needless to say, I didn't have any success.

### Stock_Market_Round_2.ipynb

This was my second attempt at predicting the stock market. This time, I used a VAE to try to encode the graph missing the final few days and then decode it. This also did not work. I tried again using a different method in [one of my School Projects](/School_Projects/AI%20Final%3A%20GAN%20Stock%20Prediction/).
